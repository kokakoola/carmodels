<h1>This is an OPEN Open Source Project</h1>

<hr />

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>No <code>--force</code> pushes</strong> or modifying the Git history in any way.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-master branches</strong> ought to be used for ongoing work.</li>
  <li><strong>External API changes and significant modifications</strong> ought to be subject to an <strong>internal pull-request</strong> to solicit feedback from other contributors.</li>
  <li>Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are <em>encouraged</em> for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.</li>
  <li>For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh in.</li>
  <li>Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Releases</h2>

<p>Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.</p>

<h2>Changes to this arrangement</h2>

<p>This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.</p>
